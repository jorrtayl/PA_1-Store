Description: This program allows the user to do things that a customer would be able to do in a store such as: check the items, purchase items, check the price, and they receive information about their purchases (receipts).

User enters the item(s) they want to buy and have the option to purchase, look at details on the item, and remove.

I have made a basic and advanced version of this program. Master is the basic and Advanced is the advanced one.
